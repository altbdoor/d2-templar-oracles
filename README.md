# Templar Oracles - D2

A small simulation on the Templar Oracles encounter, in Destiny 2, Vault of Glass.

Made after several terrible attempts in explaining the encounter. Code is probably tied together with duct tape.

    - This is in Atheon instead of Templar. Inaccurate, but it gets the job done.
